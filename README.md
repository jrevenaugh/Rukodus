# Rukodus

Basic set of sudoku tools.  
Includes functions for building filled puzzles, 
plotting puzzles, making unique puzzles with a specified
number of filled cells and symmetry.

Functions largely based on a simple add, evaluate, iterate/backtrack
algorithm.  Fast enough for easy to moderate puzzles.  Not efficient
enough for hard (27 or few filled cells) puzzles.
